## Known Gaps & Limitations

### Critical Gaps
1. **Zero Test Suite** (0% code coverage)
   - No unit, integration, or E2E tests
   - High regression risk, difficult scaling
   - **Priority**: P0 before enterprise features

2. **Missing Observability**
   - No error monitoring (Sentry/Datadog)
   - No structured logging or alerting
   - No performance dashboards
   - **Priority**: P1 for reliability

3. **Incomplete Backend Wiring**
   - Comments: UI exists, backend persistence not connected
   - Version history: UI exists, revision tracking incomplete
   - Multi-file: UI exists, full backend support unclear
   - **Priority**: P1 for feature completion

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 5.1: Production Hardening (Q3–Q4 2026)
**Goal**: Build for scale and reliability

**Testing**
- [ ] Unit tests for core business logic (auth, crypto, share lifecycle)
- [ ] Integration tests for API client
- [ ] E2E tests for critical user flows (upload → view → delete)
- [ ] Target: >80% code coverage

**Observability**
- [ ] Error monitoring (Sentry or Datadog)
- [ ] Structured logging (JSON logs to Datadog/Loki)
- [ ] Performance dashboards (Lighthouse CI, Core Web Vitals)
- [ ] Alert rules for uptime + error rate

**Security**
- [ ] Third-party security audit
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] GDPR/CCPA compliance audit + documentation
- [ ] Privacy policy update post-encryption feature

**Performance**
- [ ] Performance baseline establishment (FCP, LCP, CLS targets)
- [ ] Database query optimization (slow query logs)
- [ ] CDN cache strategy refinement

---

### Phase 5.2: Feature Completion (Q4 2026)
**Goal**: Wire incomplete features end-to-end

**Features to Complete**
- [ ] Comments: Wire backend persistence + RLS policies
- [ ] Version history: Implement revision table + restore logic
- [ ] Multi-file: Finalize backend support + file organization
- [ ] QR code: Verify backend `/api/qr/{slug}` endpoint

**New Features**
- [ ] Custom expiration dates (not just presets)
- [ ] Share templates (reusable starter content)
- [ ] Email notifications (share created, expiring soon, comments)
- [ ] Share activity feed (view events, comment activity)

---

### Phase 6: Enterprise & Growth (2027)
**Goal**: Support team scaling and revenue

**Team & Enterprise**
- [ ] White-label / custom domain support
- [ ] SSO (SAML/OIDC) for team authentication
- [ ] Advanced team permissions (read-only, comment-only, admin roles)
- [ ] Audit logs + compliance exports (GDPR data deletion)

**Monetization**
- [ ] Freemium tier (current free offering)
- [ ] Team/Pro tier ($10–20/month, increased storage + API calls)
- [ ] Enterprise tier (SSO, custom domains, priority support)
- [ ] Usage-based billing (storage overage, API rate limits)

**Growth**
- [ ] Mobile apps (iOS/Android) or feature-parity PWA
- [ ] API rate limit tiers
- [ ] Developer documentation + SDK examples
- [ ] Community forum or Slack channel

## Success Metrics

### Current (MVP Stage)
| Metric | Target | Current Status |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Uptime | > 99.9% | Not yet measured |
| Page Load (FCP) | < 1.5 sec | ~1.2 sec ✅ |
| API Response | < 500 ms | ✅ (FastAPI + Supabase) |
| Error Rate | < 0.5% | Unknown (need monitoring) |
| Code Coverage | > 80% | 0% ❌ (critical gap) |

### Scaling Targets
| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Daily Active Users | 1,000 | 10,000 |
| Monthly Uploads | ~15,000 | ~150,000 |
| ARR | — | $50k+ |
| Page Load | < 2 sec | < 1.5 sec |
| Uptime | > 99.5% | > 99.9% |

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Supabase outage | Complete downtime | Low (99.9% SLA) | Fallback RLS→app-layer, regular DR tests |
| Security breach (API key leak) | User data compromise | Low | Soft revocation, hash-only storage, audit logs |
| Performance degradation at scale | User churn | Medium | Need DB profiling, Lighthouse CI, load tests |
| Lack of tests → regression bugs | User trust ↓ | **High** | **P0: build test suite** |
| Compliance violation (GDPR) | Legal liability | Medium | Implement data deletion, update privacy policy |
| Team member absence (solo dev) | Development halt | High | Improve documentation, runbooks |

## Investment Areas

### High Value (Start Now)
1. **Test Suite** — Unblock scaling, prevent regressions
2. **Observability** — Catch production issues early
3. **Complete Backend Wiring** — Turn UI-only features into full products

### Medium Value (Start Q4 2026)
1. **Performance Optimization** — Maintain < 2 sec load times at scale
2. **Team/Enterprise Features** — Unlock B2B revenue
3. **Developer Documentation** — Support API/CLI adoption

### Lower Value (2027+)
1. **Mobile Apps** — PWA might be sufficient
2. **White-Label** — Only if enterprise tier demand exists
3. **Advanced Analytics** — Useful for SaaS but not core to MVP

---

## Execution Strategy

### Principle: Ship Value Incrementally
- **No "complete redesigns"**: Iterate on existing foundations
- **No abandoned features**: Finish what's started (e.g., comments, version history)
- **Measure impact**: A/B tests for new features, monitoring for bugs

### Development Pace
- **Velocity**: ~2-week sprints (solo dev)
- **Release Cycle**: Minor releases every 2 weeks, major every 6–8 weeks
- **Documentation**: Updated in-sync with releases

### Quality Gates
- **Before Shipping**: Manual QA on supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Before Major**: Lighthouse score > 90, no accessibility violations
- **Before Public**: 1-week staging period, monitoring dashboard active

## Questions & Next Steps

**Immediate (Next Week)**
- [ ] Verify backend wiring for comments, version history, multi-file
- [ ] Add error monitoring (Sentry setup)
- [ ] Set up performance baseline (Lighthouse CI)

**Short-Term (This Quarter)**
- [ ] Plan and scope test suite (unit + integration + E2E)
- [ ] Complete missing feature backends
- [ ] Update privacy policy post-encryption

**Long-Term (Next Quarter)**
- [ ] Implement test suite
- [ ] Plan enterprise features (SSO, white-label)
- [ ] Design monetization model
